# STEP 51 MySQL IN Operator
# The following SQL statement selects all customers that are located in "Bulgaria", "Rwanda" or "Moldova":
```
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE Country IN ('Bulgaria', 'Rwanda', 'Moldova');
```
# STEP 52  The following SQL statement selects all customers that are NOT located in "Bulgaria", "Rwanda" or "Moldova":
```
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE Country NOT IN ('Bulgaria', 'Rwanda', 'Moldova');
```
# STEP 53 The following SQL statement selects all customers that are from the same countries as the table suppliers:
```
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE Country IN (SELECT Country FROM suppliers);
```
# STEP 54 MySQL BETWEEN Operator
## The following SQL statement selects all products with a price between 10 and 80:
```
SELECT * FROM products WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 80;
```
# STEP 55 To display the products outside the range of the previous example, use NOT BETWEEN:
```
SELECT * FROM products WHERE Price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 80;
```
# STEP 56 The following SQL statement selects all products with a price between 10 and 20. In addition; do not show products with a CategoryID of 1,2, or 3:
```
SELECT * FROM products WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 80 AND CategoryID NOT IN (1,2,3);
```
# STEP 57 The following SQL statement selects all products with a ProductName between "Libero nesciunt quisquam" and "Voluptas enim libero eos":
```
SELECT * FROM products WHERE ProductName 
BETWEEN 'Libero nesciunt quisquam' AND 'Voluptas enim libero eos'
ORDER BY ProductName;
```
# STEP 58 The following SQL statement selects all products with a ProductName between "Corporis nulla et" and "Quia repellat":
```
SELECT * FROM products WHERE ProductName 
BETWEEN 'Corporis nulla et' AND 'Quia repellat'
ORDER BY ProductName;
```
# STEP 59 The following SQL statement selects all products with a ProductName not between "Nobis dolorem ab deleniti" and "Dolor sunt eos":
```
SELECT * FROM products WHERE ProductName NOT
BETWEEN 'Nobis dolorem ab deleniti' AND 'Dolor sunt eos'
ORDER BY ProductName;
```
# STEP 60 The following SQL statement selects all orders with an OrderDate between '01-July-1996' and '31-July-1996':
```
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '1996-07-01' AND '2011-07-01';
```
# STEP 61 MySQL Aliases
## The following SQL statement creates two aliases, one for the CustomerID column and one for the CustomerName column:
```
SELECT CustomerID AS ID, CustomerName AS Customer FROM customers;
```
# STEP 62 The following SQL statement creates two aliases, one for the CustomerName column and one for the ContactName column. Note: Single or double quotation marks are required if the alias name contains spaces:
```
SELECT CustomerName AS Customer, ContactName AS "Contact Person" FROM customers;
```
# STEP 63 The following SQL statement creates an alias named "Address" that combine four columns (Address, PostalCode, City and Country):
```
SELECT CustomerName, CONCAT_WS(', ', Address, Postalcode, City, Country) AS Address FROM customers;
```
# STEP 64 The following SQL statement selects all the orders from the customer with CustomerID=4 (Around the Horn). We use the "Customers" and "Orders" tables, and give them the table aliases of "c" and "o" respectively (Here we use aliases to make the SQL shorter):
```
SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName
FROM customers AS c, orders AS o
WHERE c.CustomerName='Sharon Rice' AND c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID;
```
# STEP 65 The following SQL statement is the same as above, but without aliases:
```
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Customers, Orders
WHERE Customers.CustomerName='Sharon Rice' AND Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID;
```
# STEP 66 MySQL Joins
# Then, we can create the following SQL statement (that contains an INNER JOIN), that selects records that have matching values in both tables:
```
SELECT orders.OrderID, customers.CustomerName, orders.OrderDate
FROM orders
INNER JOIN customers ON orders.CustomerID=customers.CustomerID;
```
# STEP 67 Supported Types of Joins in MySQL
- INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
- LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
- RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
- CROSS JOIN: Returns all records from both tables
# STEP 68

</p>

# STEP 69 MySQL INNER JOIN Keyword
### The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img alt="MySQL INNER JOIN" height="145" src="public/images/img_innerjoin.gif" width="200">
</p>

# STEP 70 The following SQL statement selects all orders with customer information:
#### Note: The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!
```
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```
# STEP 71 JOIN Three Tables
### The following SQL statement selects all orders with customer and shipper information:
```
SELECT orders.OrderID, customers.CustomerName, shippers.ShipperName
FROM ((orders 
INNER JOIN customers ON orders.CustomerID = customers.CustomerID)
INNER JOIN shippers ON orders.ShipperID = shippers.ShipperID); 
```
# STEP 72 MySQL LEFT JOIN Keyword
### The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records (if any) from the right table (table2).
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img alt="MySQL LEFT JOIN" height="145" src="public/images/img_leftjoin.gif" width="200">
</p>

# STEP 73 The following SQL statement will select all customers, and any orders they might have:
```
SELECT customers.CustomerName, orders.OrderID
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.CustomerID = orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY customers.CustomerName;
```
# STEP 74 MySQL RIGHT JOIN Keyword
### The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matching records (if any) from the left table (table1).
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img alt="MySQL RIGHT JOIN" height="145" src="public/images/img_rightjoin.gif" width="200">
</p>

# STEP 75 The following SQL statement will return all employees, and any orders they might have placed:
### Note: The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (Employees), even if there are no matches in the left table (Orders).
```
SELECT orders.OrderID, employees.LastName, employees.FirstName
FROM orders
RIGHT JOIN employees ON orders.EmployeeID = employees.EmployeeID
ORDER BY orders.OrderID;
```
# STEP 76 MySQL CROSS JOIN Keyword
### The CROSS JOIN keyword returns all records from both tables (table1 and table2).
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img alt="MySQL CROSS JOIN" height="145" src="public/images/img_crossjoin.png" width="200">
</p>

### Note: CROSS JOIN can potentially return very large result-sets!

# STEP 77 The following SQL statement selects all customers, and all orders:
```
SELECT customers.CustomerName, orders.OrderID
FROM customers
CROSS JOIN orders;
```
### Note: The CROSS JOIN keyword returns all matching records from both tables whether the other table matches or not. So, if there are rows in "Customers" that do not have matches in "Orders", or if there are rows in "Orders" that do not have matches in "Customers", those rows will be listed as well.
# STEP 78 If you add a WHERE clause (if table1 and table2 has a relationship), the CROSS JOIN will produce the same result as the INNER JOIN clause:
```
SELECT customers.CustomerName, orders.OrderID
FROM customers
CROSS JOIN orders
WHERE customers.CustomerID = orders.CustomerID;
```
# STEP 79 MySQL Self Join
### A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.
# The following SQL statement matches customers that are from the same city:
```
SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
FROM customers A, customers B
WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
AND A.City = B.City
ORDER BY A.City;
```
# STEP 80 MySQL UNION Operator
### The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.
- Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
- The columns must also have similar data types
- The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order

### The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use UNION ALL
### Note: The column names in the result-set are usually equal to the column names in the first SELECT statement.
# STEP 81 The following SQL statement returns the cities (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:
```
SELECT City FROM customers
UNION
SELECT City FROM suppliers
ORDER BY City;
```
### Note: If some customers or suppliers have the same city, each city will only be listed once, because UNION selects only distinct values. Use UNION ALL to also select duplicate values!
# STEP 82 The following SQL statement returns the cities (duplicate values also) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:
```
SELECT City FROM customers
UNION ALL
SELECT City FROM suppliers
ORDER BY City;
```
# STEP 83 SQL UNION With WHERE
### The following SQL statement returns the Bulgaria cities (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:
```
SELECT City, Country FROM customers
WHERE Country = 'Bulgaria'
UNION
SELECT City, Country FROM suppliers
WHERE Country = 'Bulgaria'
ORDER BY City;
```
# STEP 84 SQL UNION ALL With WHERE
### The following SQL statement returns the Bulgaria cities (duplicate values also) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:
```
SELECT City, Country FROM customers
WHERE Country = 'Bulgaria'
UNION ALL
SELECT City, Country FROM suppliers
WHERE Country = 'Bulgaria'
ORDER BY City;
```
# STEP 85 Another UNION Example
### The following SQL statement lists all customers and suppliers:
```
SELECT 'Customer' AS Type, ContactName, City, Country
FROM customers
UNION
SELECT 'Supplier', ContactName, City, Country
FROM suppliers;
```
# STEP 86 MySQL GROUP BY Statement
- The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".
- The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.
# STEP 87 MySQL GROUP BY Examples
### The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country:
```
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM customers
GROUP BY Country;
```
# STEP 88 The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country, sorted high to low:
```
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM customers
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
```
# STEP 89 GROUP BY With JOIN Example
### The following SQL statement lists the number of orders sent by each shipper:
```
SELECT shippers.ShipperName, COUNT(orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders FROM orders
LEFT JOIN shippers ON orders.ShipperID = shippers.ShipperID
GROUP BY ShipperName;
```
# STEP 90 MySQL HAVING Clause
### The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.
# STEP 91 The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country. Only include countries with more than 1 customer:
```
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 1;
```
# STEP 92 The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country, sorted high to low (Only include countries with more than 1 customer):
```
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 1
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
```
# STEP 93 The following SQL statement lists the employees that have registered more than 10 orders:
```
SELECT employees.LastName, COUNT(orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
FROM (orders
INNER JOIN employees ON orders.EmployeeID = employees.EmployeeID)
GROUP BY LastName
HAVING COUNT(orders.OrderID) > 10;
```
# STEP 94 The following SQL statement lists if the employees "Dach" or "Tillman" have registered more than 25 orders:
```
SELECT employees.LastName, COUNT(orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
FROM orders
INNER JOIN employees ON orders.EmployeeID = employees.EmployeeID
WHERE LastName = 'Dach' OR LastName = 'Tillman'
GROUP BY LastName
HAVING COUNT(orders.OrderID) > 25;
```
# STEP 95 MySQL EXISTS Operator
- The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery.
- The EXISTS operator returns TRUE if the subquery returns one or more records.
# STEP 96 The following SQL statement returns TRUE and lists the suppliers with a product price less than 50:
```
SELECT SupplierName
FROM suppliers
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM products 
WHERE products.SupplierID = suppliers.SupplierID AND Price < 50);
```
# STEP 97 The following SQL statement returns TRUE and lists the suppliers with a product price equal to 50:
```
SELECT SupplierName
FROM suppliers
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM products 
WHERE products.SupplierID = suppliers.SupplierID AND Price < 50);
```
# STEP 98 MySQL ANY and ALL Operators
- The ANY and ALL operators allow you to perform a comparison between a single column value and a range of other values.
# STEP 99 The ANY Operator
 - returns a boolean value as a result
 - returns TRUE if ANY of the subquery values meet the condition
 - ANY means that the condition will be true if the operation is true for any of the values in the range.
 ## ANY Syntax
 ```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator ANY
  (SELECT column_name
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition);
 ```
 ### Note: The operator must be a standard comparison operator (=, <>, !=, >, >=, <, or <=).
# STEP 100 The ALL Operator
- returns a boolean value as a result
- returns TRUE if ALL of the subquery values meet the condition
- is used with SELECT, WHERE and HAVING statements
### ALL means that the condition will be true only if the operation is true for all values in the range.
## ALL Syntax With SELECT
```
SELECT ALL column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
## ALL Syntax With WHERE or HAVING
```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator ALL
  (SELECT column_name
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition);
```
# STEP 101 SQL ANY Examples
### The following SQL statement lists the ProductName if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity equal to 10 (this will return TRUE because the Quantity column has some values of 10):
```
SELECT ProductName 
FROM products
WHERE ProductID = ANY
(SELECT ProductID
 FROM order_details
WHERE Quantity = 10);
```
# STEP 102 The following SQL statement lists the ProductName if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity larger than 99 (this will return TRUE because the Quantity column has some values larger than 99):
```
SELECT ProductName
FROM products
WHERE ProductID = ANY
(SELECT ProductID
 FROM order_details
WHERE Quantity > 99);
```
# STEP 103 The following SQL statement lists the ProductName if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity larger than 1000 (this will return FALSE because the Quantity column has no values larger than 1000):
```
SELECT ProductName
FROM products
WHERE ProductID = ANY
  (SELECT ProductID
  FROM order_details
  WHERE Quantity > 1000);
```
# STEP 104  SQL ALL Examples
- The following SQL statement lists ALL the product names:
```
SELECT ALL ProductName
FROM products
WHERE TRUE;
```
# STEP 105 MySQL INSERT INTO SELECT
- The INSERT INTO SELECT statement copies data from one table and inserts it into another table.
- The INSERT INTO SELECT statement requires that the data types in source and target tables matches.
### Note: The existing records in the target table are unaffected.
# STEP 106 INSERT INTO SELECT Syntax
### Copy all columns from one table to another table:
```
INSERT INTO table2
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE condition;
```
# STEP 107 Copy only some columns from one table into another table:
```
INSERT INTO table2 (column1, column2, column3, ...)
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM table1
WHERE condition;
```
# STEP 108 MySQL INSERT INTO SELECT Examples
### The following SQL statement copies "Suppliers" into "Customers" (the columns that are not filled with data, will contain NULL):
```
INSERT INTO customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
SELECT SupplierName, City, Country FROM suppliers;
```
# STEP 109 The following SQL statement copies "Suppliers" into "Customers" (fill all columns):
```
INSERT INTO customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
SELECT SupplierName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country FROM suppliers;
```

# STEP 110 MySQL CASE Statement
### The CASE statement goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met (like an if-then-else statement). So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it returns the value in the ELSE clause.
### If there is no ELSE part and no conditions are true, it returns NULL.

# STEP 111 CASE Syntax
```
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
    ELSE result
END;
```
# STEP 112 The following SQL goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met:
```
SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
CASE
	WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN 'The quantity is greater than 30'
  WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN 'The quantity is 30'
	ELSE 'The quantity is under 30'
END AS Quantity
FROM order_details;
```
# STEP 113 The following SQL will order the customers by City. However, if City is NULL, then order by Country:
```
SELECT CustomerName, City, Country
FROM customers
ORDER BY
(CASE
 WHEN City IS NULL THEN Country
 ELSE City
END); 
```
# STEP 114 SOME
```
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE Price > SOME (SELECT Price FROM products WHERE Price > 20);
```
# STEP 115 MySQL Database
# STEP 116 MySQL CREATE DATABASE Statement
```
CREATE DATABASE testDB;
```
# STEP 117 MySQL DROP DATABASE Statement
```
DROP DATABASE testDB;
```
# STEP 118 MySQL CREATE TABLE Statement
### The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in a database.
### Syntax
```
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
   ....
);
```
- The column parameters specify the names of the columns of the table.
- The datatype parameter specifies the type of data the column can hold (e.g. varchar, integer, date, etc.).
# STEP 119 The following example creates a table called "Persons" that contains five columns: PersonID, LastName, FirstName, Address, and City:
```
CREATE TABLE Persons (
	ID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  LastName VARCHAR(255),
  FirstName VARCHAR(255),
  Address VARCHAR(255),
  City VARCHAR(255)
);
```
- The ID column is of type int and will hold an integer.
- The LastName, FirstName, Address, and City columns are of type varchar and will hold characters, and the maximum length for these fields is 255 characters.
 
# STEP 120 Create Table Using Another Table
- A copy of an existing table can also be created using CREATE TABLE.
- The new table gets the same column definitions. All columns or specific columns can be selected.
- If you create a new table using an existing table, the new table will be filled with the existing values from the old table.

### Syntax
```
CREATE TABLE new_table_name AS
    SELECT column1, column2,...
    FROM existing_table_name
    WHERE ....;
``` 
# STEP 121 The following SQL creates a new table called "TestTables" (which is a copy of the "Customers" table): 
```
CREATE TABLE TestTable AS
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName
FROM customers;
```
# STEP 122 MySQL ALTER TABLE Statement
- The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
- The ALTER TABLE statement is also used to add and drop various constraints on an existing table.
# STEP 123 ALTER TABLE - ADD Column
### To add a column in a table, use the following syntax:
```
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;
```
# STEP 124 The following SQL adds an "Email" column to the "Customers" table:
```
ALTER TABLE customers 
ADD Email varchar(255);
```
# STEP 125 ALTER TABLE - DROP COLUMN
### The following SQL deletes the "Email" column from the "Customers" table:
```
ALTER TABLE customers
DROP COLUMN Email;
```
# STEP 126 ADD VALUES IN TABLE Persons:
```
INSERT INTO Persons
(LastName, FirstName, Address, City)
VALUES
('Hansen', 'Ola', 'Timoteivn-10', 'Sandnes');

INSERT INTO Persons
(LastName, FirstName, Address, City)
VALUES
('Svendson', 'Tove', 'Borgvn 23', 'Sandnes');

INSERT INTO Persons
(LastName, FirstName, Address, City)
VALUES
('Peterson', 'Kari', 'Storgt 20', 'Stavanger');
```
# STEP 127 ALTER TABLE - MODIFY COLUMN
### To change the data type of a column in a table, use the following syntax:
```
ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype;
```
# STEP 128 Now we want to add a column named "DateOfBirth" in the "Persons" table.
```
ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD DateOfBirth date;
```
# STEP 129 Change Data Type Example
- Now we want to change the data type of the column named "DateOfBirth" in the "Persons" table.
- We use the following SQL statement:
```
ALTER TABLE Persons 
MODIFY COLUMN DateOfBirth year;
```
# STEP 130 DROP COLUMN Example
```
ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP COLUMN DateOfBirth;
```
# STEP 131 MySQL Constraints
- SQL constraints are used to specify rules for data in a table.
### Create Constraints
- Constraints can be specified when the table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement, or after the table is created with the ALTER TABLE statement.
### Syntax:
```
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype constraint,
    column2 datatype constraint,
    column3 datatype constraint,
    ....
);
```
- SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.
- Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, the action is aborted
- Constraints can be column level or table level. Column level constraints apply to a column, and table level constraints apply to the whole table.
# The following constraints are commonly used in SQL:
- NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
- UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
- PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
- FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables
- CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
- DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
- CREATE INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly
